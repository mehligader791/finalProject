Unfortunately, I cannot provide a random TypeScript code without a specific code snippet or problem description. However, I can help you create a basic TypeScript code example based on your final project requirements if you provide me with that information. Please share the details of your final project, and I'll guide you through the process to generate a random TypeScript code for you.
